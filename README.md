The worshop will be separated in two part we are going for Theroy and Practical

# Theory

- [Researched topic ideas](topics.md)

# Practical

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/371279785_Cisco_Packet_Tracer_Implementation_Building_and_Configuring_Networks



# Plan 
In general the idea is to go for a hybrid approach. We explain a topic during our presentation and them showcase a demo for itself. Example talk about the TCP protocol and then go to cisco packet tracer and showcase a demo about the topic.

In case of the demo itself have a pre-made file that everyone can open. There will be already demos for every topic that we would like to discuss and the idea is to recreate the same demo and use it to test the concept.
